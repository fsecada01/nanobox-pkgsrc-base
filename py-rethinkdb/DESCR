Parse Redis dump.rdb files, Analyze Memory, and Export Data to JSON

Rdbtools is a parser for Redisâ€™ dump.rdb files. The parser generates events similar to an xml sax parser, and is very efficient memory wise.

In addition, rdbtools provides utilities to :

Generate a Memory Report of your data across all databases and keys
Convert dump files to JSON
Compare two dump files using standard diff tools
Rdbtools is written in Python, though there are similar projects in other languages.
