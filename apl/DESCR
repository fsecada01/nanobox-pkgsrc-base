GNU APL is a free interpreter for the programming language APL. 

The APL interpreter is an (almost) complete implementation of ISO standard 13751 aka. Programming Language APL, Extended. 

The APL interpreter has implemented:
nested arrays and related functions
complex numbers, and
a shared variable interface
In addition, GNU APL can be scripted. For example, this HTML page is the output of a CGI script written in APL. 

GNU APL was written and is being maintained by JÃ¼rgen Sauermann.
