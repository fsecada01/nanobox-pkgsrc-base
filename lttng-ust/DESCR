The Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation is an open source software toolkit which you can use to simultaneously trace the Linux kernel, user applications, and user libraries.
LTTng consists of:
Kernel modules to trace the Linux kernel.
Shared libraries to trace user applications written in C or C++.
Java packages to trace Java applications which use java.util.logging or Apache log4j 1.2.
A Python package to trace Python applications which use the standard logging package.
A kernel module to trace shell scripts and other user applications without a dedicated instrumentation mechanism.
Daemons and a command-line tool, lttng, to control the LTTng tracers.
